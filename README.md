# Data Analysis Scripts

This repository contains Python scripts used for data analysis. The main scripts are:

- `Comparing_Code.py`: Compares network metrics from different datasets and generates visualizations.
- `CubicSpline.py`: Performs cubic spline interpolation to fix extreme values in time-series datasets.

## Setup
To run the scripts, make sure to have the required libraries installed:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scipy

Usage
Comparing_Code.py: This script loads CSV datasets, computes key network metrics, and visualizes the comparison.
CubicSpline.py: This script applies cubic spline interpolation to columns in time-series datasets with extreme values.
